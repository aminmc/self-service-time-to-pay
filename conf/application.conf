# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `my.application.app.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and `conf/app.routes`)

# Global object class

# Define the Global object class for this application.
